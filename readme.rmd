# IIHF Report Analysis

## Introduction

Each year, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) publishes a 
report about the events of the previous hockey season. The report also 
contains data on the number of hockey players in each country. The goal 
of this project is to extract the information and make it available for 
data analysis.
